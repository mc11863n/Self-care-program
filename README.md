Self-care program
Anyone looking for help for skincare products 
User inputs oily skin, dry skin, unopen spores, etc.
Outputs recommendation and links to the products
The functions used in this program will be
o	Strings and Numbers (ints and/or floats)
o	Mathematical operations (+,-,*,/,%)
o	Sequences (strings, lists, tuples, and/or dictionaries)
o	Loops (for and/or while)
o	Functions
o	Classes

We plan to create the project thru the user asking the program what they are dealing with and what skin care they should use to maintain or get rid of the situation. The program must be able to output the skin condition they are dealing with, what product they should use, how much they can use, and be able to give them a link to the recommended product.
